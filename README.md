## CEP146NDD groupwork - Project 2

**TOPIC**
Open source AI tools that we can run on our own laptops as a cheaper alternative to expensive AI apps.
（We can demo how ChatGPT helps us set up a local image generator and then discuss how this lets us use AI to learn AI without paying a lot.）

## Summary
Our idea for our AI current event project is to talk about how open source AI tools that run on your own computer are becoming an alternative to expensive commercial AI apps.
We can show a small demo where we use ChatGPT to help us set up a simple local image generator with a free model, and then discuss how students can use AI to learn AI and avoid wasting money on overpriced tools.

## Final Test Question
If powerful open-source AI tools are free to run at home, will this reduce inequality in access to AI, or will it create new risks that require stronger regulation?
