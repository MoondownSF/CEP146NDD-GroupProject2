# *Video script*
After installing, we start script from PowerShell so we can see the logs. 

I enter the folder path and run it, just like in OPS. 

Now our local image generator is ready. 

I type flower, set a smaller size, and click Generate. 

In PowerShell you can see every step, and the GPU starts working.

This is a very basic model in 2023

This a platform I often use. Most models here are free to download and use

Please Rumber, always check the license before using any model.

And our flower is finished.
